# Decision-Tree-R

The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information directly relates cars like (safety rate, number of seats…) to evaluate the car level, consist of 1328 instance.
Tecision tree model correctly recognizes evaluation level of a car based on a set of 6 features. 

Steps:
Divide the data set into 2 subsets, 1st one will be 80% of the data and call it “Training Set”, 2nd set will be 20% of the data, and call it “Testing Set”.
Build the decision tree using the training set.
Use the decision tree model to predict the label of the testing set instances.
Use the testing set to evaluate your model in terms of accuracy.
